### `eCAD/`

Contains Altium Designer source files, schematics, fabrication outputs, and documentation.

### `mCAD/`

Contains 3D mechanical designs (Inventor 2025) and printable STL models.

## 🛠️ Build It Yourself

### 1. Get the Parts

> For users without in-house fabrication capabilities.

- **PCB**: Order from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) (includes assembly service). Refer to the [Bill of Materials (BOM)](eCAD/Assembly/BOM.xlsx) for manual assembly.
- **3D Prints**: Print the mechanical components using any 3D printing service. JLCPCB also offers 3D printing at competitive prices.

See the [JLCPCB Assembly Tutorial](https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/assembly) for step-by-step instructions.

### 2. Assembly & Installation

1. Place the **ring** under the potentiometer and insert it into the PCB before soldering. This ensures alignment with the BNC connector.
2. Insert the **button** into the tactile switch.
3. Attach the **base** underneath the PCB.
4. Open the monitor’s rear panel and locate the 6-pin cable connected to the motherboard. Disconnect it and plug it into the white 6-pin connector on the circuit board.
5. Connect the monitor's **live and neutral wires** to the 2-pin screw terminal on the board.
6. Drill the back panel of the monitor to accommodate the BNC, potentiometer, and pushbutton.

   Use `mCAD/panel_drill.dxf` or refer to the manual drill dimensions below:

   </p>

7. Mount the PCB to the panel and reassemble the monitor.

## ⚙️ Fine-Tuning the Blanking Driver

The blanking driver circuit is designed to support a wide range of monitor backlight types. However, to ensure optimal performance, you may need to fine-tune the **VLED** voltage.

### 🔧 Voltage Adjustment Guidelines

- Press the pushbutton to force the monitor **ON**, then use the trimmer **R9** to adjust the **VLED** until the backlight reaches the desired brightness level.
- The **VLED** voltage can be adjusted within the range of **41 V to 61 V**.
  > The recommended **VLED** is at least **2 V higher** than the forward voltage of the backlight panel.
